# notes for analysis from 10/28 call

- for measurement reliability analysis, we need a validity check from the CDIs
- don't exclude the zoners on accuracy in the models OR the descriptive analysis - check this exclusion! (models and devo analysis)
- devo analysis - can we model out item variation? e.g., don't model subject random effects, just model lab and item variation and get rid of that to get the linear effect clearer?

- use the CDI validity check to look at the different principal components (devo analysis)
- need to check the effect of window size on RT - accuracy correlation (in devo analysis)
- can we use baseline looking as a proxy regressor for salience (in THINGS analysis)?
- check models in the THINGS regressions, what is going on with the RT models
