One thing that we learn from Analysis 3 that is reiterated here is that the best summaries seem to be:

* elogit(accuracy) for accuracy - note this involves excluding some trials in which elogit is at floor or ceiling because of zoning. we think this doesn't help OR hurt.
* log(age) - development follows some kind of exponential so logging makes it more linear.
* log(rt) - reaction times are somewhat log normal in distribution.

All of these variable transformations serve to "linearize" these various different measures that all have distributions that are otherwise not as amenable to modeling.

Our goal here is to look at how these measures change together - both across age and across participants. 

# General development: Accuracy

First let's just look at average and predicted accuracy trajectories with development. 

```{r}
ms_acc <- d_acc |>
  ungroup() |>
  group_by(dataset_name, administration_id, age) |>
  summarise(n_accuracy = n(), 
            accuracy = mean(accuracy, na.rm=TRUE), 
            elogit = mean(elogit, na.rm=TRUE)) |>
  mutate(log_age = log(age))

labels <- data_frame(age = c(12,24,36,48), y = -1) |>
  mutate(log_age = log(age), 
         age_mo = paste(as.character(age), "months"))

ref_75 <- log( (75 + .5) / (25 + .5) )

ggplot(ms_acc, aes(x = log_age, y = elogit)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1, width = .02, height = 0) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "green") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = ref_75, lty = 2) +
  annotate("text", x = log(12), y = 0, label = "50% correct", vjust = -.25, hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = log(12), y = ref_75, label = "75% correct", vjust = -.25, hjust = 0) +
  geom_vline(data = labels, 
             aes(xintercept = log_age), lty = 3) + 
  geom_text(data = labels, 
             aes(x = log_age, y = y, label = age_mo), lty = 3, hjust = 0) + 
  xlab("log(age)") +
  ylab("elogit (accuracy)") + 
  theme_few() +
  ggtitle(glue("Accuracy increases with age (N={nrow(ms_acc)})"))
```
Look at how unremarkable this looks in the original accuracy/age space. 

```{r}
ggplot(ms_acc, aes(x = age, y = accuracy)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1, width = .02, height = 0) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "green") + 
  xlab("log(age)") +
  ylab("elogit (accuracy)") + 
  theme_few() +
  ggtitle(glue("Accuracy increases with age (N={nrow(ms_acc)})"))

```


# General developmental changes in RT

```{r}
ms_rt <- d_rt |>
  ungroup() |>
  group_by(dataset_name, administration_id, age) |>
  summarise(n_rt = n(),
            rt = mean(rt, na.rm=TRUE),
            log_rt = mean(log_rt, na.rm=TRUE)) |>
  mutate(log_age = log(age))

```

Now plot. 

```{r}
labels <- data_frame(age = c(12,24,36,48), y = log(300)) |>
  mutate(log_age = log(age), 
         age_mo = paste(as.character(age), "months"))

ref_750 <- log(750)
ref_1000 <- log(1000)

ggplot(ms_rt, aes(x = log_age, y = log_rt)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1, width = .02, height = 0) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = ref_750, lty = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = ref_1000, lty = 2) +
  annotate("text", x = log(12), y = ref_750, label = "750 ms", vjust = -.25, hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = log(12), y = ref_1000, label = "1000 ms", vjust = -.25, hjust = 0) + 
  geom_vline(data = labels, 
             aes(xintercept = log_age), lty = 3) + 
  geom_text(data = labels, 
             aes(x = log_age, y = y, label = age_mo), lty = 3, hjust = 0) + 
  xlab("log(age)") +
  ylab("log(RT)") + 
  theme_few() +
  ggtitle(glue("Reaction time decreases with age (N={nrow(ms_acc)})"))
```

# Relation between RT and accuracy 

OK, let's take a look at these subject and word-level measures. 


```{r}

acc_rt <- inner_join(ms_acc, ms_rt) |>
  mutate(age_group_years = cut(age, breaks = c(12,24,36,48,60)))

head(acc_rt)
```


Take a look at correlations to select variables. 

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(select(ungroup(acc_rt), -dataset_name, -age_group_years, -n_accuracy, -n_rt, -administration_id), 
        progress = FALSE, lower = list(continuous = GGally::wrap("points", alpha = 0.03)))

```
It turns out that the correlations between elogit(accuracy), log(age), and log(rt) are all stronger. So we'll adopt these. 


```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(select(ungroup(acc_rt), elogit, log_rt, log_age), 
        progress = FALSE, lower = list(continuous = GGally::wrap("points", alpha = 0.03)))

```

So these are somewhat related to one another. Let's take a deeper look. 

```{r}
ggplot(acc_rt, aes(x = log_rt, y = elogit, col = log_age)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, lty = 2) + 
  xlab("Mean log RT") + 
  ylab("Mean elogit(accuracy)")
```

Broken out by age group. 

```{r}
ggplot(acc_rt, aes(x = log_rt, y = elogit)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, lty = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~age_group_years) + 
  xlab("Mean log RT") + 
  ylab("Mean elogit accuracy")

  
```

By dataset. 

```{r}
ggplot(acc_rt, aes(x = log_rt, y = elogit, col = log_age)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, lty = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset_name) + 
  xlab("Mean log RT") + 
  ylab("Mean elogit accuracy")

```

## Dimensionality reduction

Let's do principal components analysis over the scaled variables. 

```{r}
acc_rt_mat <- acc_rt |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(log_age, elogit, log_rt) |>
  mutate(log_age = scale(log_age)[,1], 
         log_rt = scale(log_rt)[,1],
         elogit = scale(elogit)[,1] )|>
  as.matrix()

acc_rt_prc <- prcomp(acc_rt_mat, 2)

acc_rt_prc
summary(acc_rt_prc)
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(acc_rt_prc, alpha = .1)


```

We see that there is a first component with ~60% of variance that is "faster, more accurate, older". Then we see a second component that relates to younger, faster, slightly less accurate. And the final piece is older and less accurate.

These would be interesting components to connect to CDI. In some sense, the claim of some of the Fernald processing corpus is that there is a second principal component here (namely, processing speed) that is meaningful and relates to later learning outcomes. 

# Conclusions

Probably right now we need to try and connect this to CDIs...
